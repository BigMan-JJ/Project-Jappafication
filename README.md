#The Jappafication Project
This resource pack aims to provide jappa-style textures for your favourite mods of 1.12.2! At the moment it's in early alpha.

If you want to contribute, you are more than welcome! Just make a pull request for me to review. 

Please note that this pack does NOT include vanilla minecraft textures! It is highly recommended to use it with packs like Modernity and/or Actually Correct Default Texture Backport.


Screenshots coming soon!
